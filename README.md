Bubble is at the same time a visual programming tool and a cloud platform. You use the programming tool to build your applications, while the cloud platform hosts and runs them

* Here's the main page

Bubble lets you build web applications.By combining different data and logic operations, you can create very simple to extremely complicated applications. 

Bubble is one platform that does it all for you, which means you no longer have to be a coder

* The Application Editor

You design, build, maintain, and scale your app using the Application Editor. The editor is structured around seven main tabs (this tabs are in the left corner of the first image)

* Design tab

This is where you design the visual appearance of the app. Draw elements on the page, drag and resize them, and adjust their properties and appearance.

* Workflow tab

The Workflow Tab is where you define the workflows that program your page. The different workflows are displayed as boxes, which represent the event.

* Data tab

The Data Tab is where you can view your data structure and modify it. You can see the different data types that are used in your application, as well as the fields for each of them. The 'App Data' section shows you actual data. 

* Styles tab

The Styles Tab is where you define the different styles that elements can have in your interface. A Style is a shared set of properties (e.g. background colors, font size, etc.) that can be applied to elements of a similar type (e.g. Text elements). 

* Plugins tab

Plugins are a way to extend Bubble's core functionality. For instance, you will have to install plugins in your application if you want to use an element that has been built by the Community

* Settings tab

This tab lets you control your application subscription and paid add-ons. In the Settings tab, you will also find some application-wide settings that you will have to define before launching your application. 

* Logs tab

This tab is useful once your app is live, or when you are testing it in Run-mode. You can use the server logs to help diagnose past events and workflow issues
